# Decision Tree Implementation

The project contains the source code needed to build a decision tree learning algorithm and classify new entries whether their salary is below 50K or above 50K. Details about more than 32000 people have been given in the dataset and the task is to build a decision tree and classify using a depth first search approach. 

The tree node attributes have been assigned based on their information gain and the best attributes have been chosen for that particular node. Missing and continuous values have been taken care of in the algorithm.
